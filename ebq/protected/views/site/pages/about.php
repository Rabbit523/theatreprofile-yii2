<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Theatre Profile was born out of our desire to see theatre information online in one place. We were frustrated with having to go to different websites for theatre information. So, we created Theatre Profile - an online community for all who love theatre, professionals and the public, for the big shows and the community productions.</p>

<h1>Editing Content on the site</h1>
<p>We are looking for editors during our BETA. <a href="mailto:info@TheatreProfile.com">Email</a> us and let us know why you would be a good editor. You will be able to add content and edit any content on the site. Help us promote theatre and those in the industry.</p>
